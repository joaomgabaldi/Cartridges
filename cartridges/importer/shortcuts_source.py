"""Windows source that imports game shortcuts (``.lnk`` / ``.url``).

Handles classic ``.lnk`` shortcuts (resolved to their target executable),
``.url`` internet shortcuts (protocol launchers such as ``steam://`` or
``com.epicgames.launcher://``) and ``.lnk`` shortcuts to UWP/Microsoft Store
apps (launched through ``shell:AppsFolder``).

``.lnk`` files are resolved in a single batch through PowerShell's
``WScript.Shell`` and ``Shell.Application`` COM objects, which requires no
third-party Python dependency and is able to read both the target path and the
AppUserModelID needed to launch Store apps.
