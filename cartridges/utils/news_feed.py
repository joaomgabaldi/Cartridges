"""Read the repack site's RSS feed as *news*: everything that is not a digest.

One document, two readers with opposite appetites.
:mod:`cartridges.utils.updates_feed` wants the periodic *Updates Digest* posts,
whose bodies are machine fodder for the per-game patch notice. This module wants
the other half — new repacks, site announcements, anything a person would
actually sit and read — and drops the digests on the floor.

That exclusion is the whole point of the split and it only goes one way. A
digest never reaches the Novidades page: its body is a wall of collapsible
spoiler markup that reads as noise, and every game it names is already surfaced
on that game's own details page. Conversely a news post is never handed to the
update matcher, which would happily mistake a repack announcement for a patch.

Only the parts of an ``<item>`` that a list row can show are kept: title, link,
publication date, and a short plain-text excerpt cut out of the HTML summary.
