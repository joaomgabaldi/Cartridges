"""Read the repack site's RSS feed and pull the patched-game lists out of it.

The site itself sits behind an aggressive firewall/Cloudflare rule that blocks
plain HTML scraping, but the RSS feed is served straight through, so the whole
update signal is taken from there and nowhere else.

Only one kind of post matters: the periodic *Updates Digest*, whose body lists
the games that just received a patch. Each game is a collapsible spoiler shaped
like this::

    <div class="su-spoiler ...">
      <div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Game</div>
      <div class="su-spoiler-content ...">
        <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site/game/">Repack page</a>
        ... download links ...
      </div>
    </div>

Two things are lifted from each spoiler: the *title* text (the bare game name,
used for matching) and the *Repack page* link inside the content (the game's own
page, offered to the user when they act on the notice). Everything else — the
file-host anchors and the ``.rar`` list items thick with version numbers — is
download plumbing and is deliberately ignored: reading it as a title yields
either noise or a numeric signature the matcher rightly rejects.
