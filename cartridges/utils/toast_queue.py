"""One toast at a time, in the order they were raised.

Adw.ToastOverlay keeps a queue of its own, but a HIGH priority toast jumps it:
it replaces whatever is on screen and pushes that one back into the queue. When
several unrelated things speak up at once — the startup import, the update
check, the import summary — the result is a toast being cut off mid-life and
then coming back, which reads like a glitch.

This class owns the overlay instead. Only ever one toast is handed to it, and
the next one is added once the previous is gone, so a burst of toasts plays as a
queue: no toast is interrupted, none is shown twice.

Because a queued toast is not in the overlay yet, `Adw.Toast.dismiss` silently
does nothing to it — always cancel through :meth:`ToastQueue.dismiss`, which
handles both cases and still emits ``dismissed`` so callers keeping their own
bookkeeping (the undo toasts) hear about it either way.
