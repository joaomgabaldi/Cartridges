"""The official horizontal logo shown as the details page header.

The logo is branding, not artwork: it replaces the game's title where the
title used to be, so everything here is built around staying inside the space
a title occupied. Nothing is ever invented locally — a game either has a real
logo on SteamGridDB or it keeps its text title.

Every lookup is remembered on disk, hits and misses alike. A hit is kept for
good: a logo on screen stays on screen, and only renaming the game (or picking
another one by hand) replaces it. A miss is retried after a week, because art
added to SteamGridDB later should still reach the game, while asking on every
visit would be a request per page view for an answer that rarely changes.
