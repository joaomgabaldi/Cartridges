"""Utilities to normalize raw game names coming from shortcuts/file names.

Shortcut file names frequently carry technical clutter such as
``Game (DX12)``, ``Game - Windows``, ``Game™`` or ``Game - Shortcut`` that
hurts both readability and online cover/metadata lookups. ``clean_game_name``
strips that noise conservatively, never returning an empty string.
