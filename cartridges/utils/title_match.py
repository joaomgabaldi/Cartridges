"""Compare a local game title against a store title.

Matching titles by string equality is too brittle: the same game shows up as
``Game``, ``Game™``, ``Game®`` or ``Game: Definitive Edition``, and sequel
numbers alternate between arabic and roman digits (``Civilization VI`` /
``Civilization 6``). But loosening the comparison until those all match also
makes ``The Outer Worlds`` match ``The Outer Worlds 2``, which is a *different
game* — the exact failure this module exists to prevent.

The way out is to treat the two kinds of difference separately instead of
running everything through one similarity score:

1. **Normalization** flattens the noise. Trademark signs, punctuation, case,
   accents and article words disappear, and every numeral is rewritten to a
   canonical integer, so ``VI`` and ``6`` become the same token.
2. **The numeric signature is a hard gate.** The ordered list of numbers in a
   title is its identity: ``[]`` for ``The Outer Worlds`` and ``[2]`` for
   ``The Outer Worlds 2``. Differing signatures are rejected outright, before
   any scoring, so no amount of textual similarity can ever collapse a game
   into its own sequel.
3. **The remaining words are scored.** Extra words that are only edition
   fluff (``Definitive Edition``, ``GOTY``) still identify the same game;
   extra words naming separate content (``Soundtrack``, a DLC's subtitle) do
   not.
