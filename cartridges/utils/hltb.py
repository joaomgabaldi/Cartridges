"""Fetch completion time estimates from HowLongToBeat.

HowLongToBeat publishes no API. Its search is ``POST /api/bleed``, guarded by
a short-lived credential from ``GET /api/bleed/init`` — a token plus a honeypot
pair whose *field name* is randomised per session and has to be echoed both as
a header and inside the request body. The token itself encodes the client's IP
and User-Agent, so the credential and the search must come from one session
sending identical headers, and it expires: a 403 means "re-init and retry",
which is exactly what the site's own front end does.

Three routes exist, and :func:`fetch_times` picks between them:

* :meth:`HLTBHelper.resolve` searches by title. Needs the credential, and is
  only used the first time a game is looked up.
* :meth:`HLTBHelper.get_times_by_id` reads the server-rendered ``/game/<id>``
  page, where the same numbers are embedded in the markup. No credential, no
  handshake — so once a game's id is known, every later refresh takes this
  route and never touches the guarded endpoint.
* :meth:`HLTBHelper.resolve_chapters` assembles a breakdown for the few games
  the site only catalogues chapter by chapter (``_CHAPTER_SERIES``), which have
  no single page to point at.

Times are in seconds — the same unit :attr:`Game.playtime` uses — so the two
never need converting to sit side by side. They are never compared: this
module only provides a reference table.

If this ever breaks, the endpoint and payload were recovered by reading the
``fetch("/api/bleed"...)`` call in the homepage's JS chunks; that is where to
look again.

# so the ordinary filter threw away four fifths of the answer.
#
# Letting them in is safe precisely here and nowhere else: this route never
