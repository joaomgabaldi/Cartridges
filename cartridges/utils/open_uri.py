"""Hand a URL to the user's browser, safely and without warnings.

Two things live here that were previously scattered and slightly wrong at every
call site.

The scheme guard: several of these URLs are lifted out of a third-party RSS
feed, so only ``http``/``https`` is ever followed. A ``file:`` or ``javascript:``
URL that finds its way into a post must not become an OS-level launch just
because someone clicked a row.

The launcher: ``Gio.AppInfo.launch_default_for_uri(uri, None)`` was used
throughout, which trips a ``G_IS_APP_LAUNCH_CONTEXT`` assertion in GIO — it is
being handed no launch context at all, and the browser window it opens is
parented to nothing. :class:`Gtk.UriLauncher` builds the context itself and
accepts the window the click came from, which is what the platform expects.
