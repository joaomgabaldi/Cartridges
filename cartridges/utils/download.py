"""Small helpers to read HTTP bodies into memory with a size cap.

Covers are portrait images (~600x900); even animated ones rarely exceed a few
megabytes. Capping the download keeps a misbehaving or oversized URL from
exhausting memory, and streaming means the cap is enforced even when the server
lies about (or omits) the Content-Length header. The request timeout does not
bound size: it limits silence between bytes, not the total.
