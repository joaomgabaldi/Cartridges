"""Poll the repack feed and light up the "update available" notice per game.

The network half runs on a worker thread; the moment it lands, everything that
touches game state or the UI is bounced back onto the main thread, because the
save/update signals drive GTK widgets and those are not thread-safe.

The state model is deliberately tiny and lives on the games themselves (see
:class:`~cartridges.game.Game`), so this class holds no per-game memory and
caches no game lists — exactly the constraint the design calls for. Novelty is
decided per game by a single timestamp, ``update_dismissed_ts``: a digest is
"new to this game" when it is more recent than the last patch the user
dismissed. A freshly opted-in game has a dismissed timestamp of 0, so it is
caught up on the most recent digest that mentions it the first time the feed is
read, and everything after that is gated by what the user has acknowledged. The
feed only carries recent posts, so this can never surface an old back-catalogue.
